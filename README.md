This project is an implmentation of A* search algorithm for the purposes of generating optimal solutions to a game. The game entails a number of ducks with a certain amount of energy. The ducks expend energy to move, and they can transfer to ducks adjacent to them. The ducks must capture a flag opposite of their origin site and return it back to the other side. This project is written in Java.
